## 📊 Dataset Information

### Dataset Type
AI Tools Catalog

### Data Format
- Static JSON file located at:
```

src/data/tools.json

````

### Fields Used

Each tool includes:

- name  
- slug  
- category  
- pricing  
- description  
- website  
- logo  

### Dataset Source

The dataset was curated manually by referencing public AI tool directories and reformatted into a structured JSON format suitable for static generation.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- All tool data is stored in a static JSON file  
- Pages are generated at build time using Next.js SSG  
- Dynamic routes create individual tool pages  
- Filtering and searching happen client-side  
- Metadata is generated dynamically for SEO  

---

## 🧩 Key Pages

- `/` – Home page  
- `/tools` – Tools listing page  
- `/tools/[slug]` – Individual tool detail page  
- `/categories/[category]` – Category-based listing  

---

## 🔍 SEO Implementation

- SEO-friendly dynamic routes  
- Metadata generation  
- Sitemap generation  
- Robots configuration  
- Clean URL structure  

---

## 🧪 ESLint & Prettier Setup

The project includes proper configuration for:

- Code formatting  
- Style consistency  
- Linting and error detection  

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # Start development server
npm run build     # Build project
npm run start     # Start production build
npm run lint      # Run ESLint
npm run format    # Format code using Prettier
````
